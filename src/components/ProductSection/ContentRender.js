                commitment. This possibility gives customers an opportunity to
                keep coins, as well as get the needed cash for a short-term and
                profit in a long term. Imagine a customer that has one coin which
                is worth $ 10.0K today. They need extra appliances to work out the
                additional cryptocurrency, so they decide to pawn the coin for 80%
                of its price, i.e. $8.0K. They use cash to expand mining, earn
                money and after a month pay off the pawn for $8.4K. By this time,
                the price of coin has risen to $20.0K. If they exchange the coin
                into cash they will get $9.6K profit from the transaction. Please
                note, that actual rates may vary."
